# Emoji Translator Site
## A frontend for the emoji translator
This site is a frontend for the emoji translator. It allows users to input text and receive a translation of the text into emojis. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made this site to learn more about http requests.


Here is an example Sentence to test the translator:
    >Hello, how are you? Do you want to get some donuts after work? We could also go to the movies. That would make me very happy!
